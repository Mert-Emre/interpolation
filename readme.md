To run the project you need to run the command npm run start and this will run the backend server. Due to the cors restrictions the websocket implements, you should access to the backend server from a frontend server located at port 5500. VS Code live-server extension automatically creates a server that serves the index.html file and you can use it.<br>
In this project I implemented client side prediction, server reconciliation and entity interpolation techniques with js. Demonstration link:<br>
